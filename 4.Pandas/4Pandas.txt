#MErging Joinig and Concat

pd.concat([df1,df2])
concatenates dataframes if their dimensions are matching.
Default axis of concat is 0, along the rows

pd.concat([df1,df2],axis=1)
It's like the full outer join, not matching cols furnish NaN

#Merging allows us to merge data together based on some given logic

pd.merge(left,right,how='inner',on='key')

#as merge is for cols, join is used to merge on indices:

#For potentially differently indexed dataFrames
left.join(right)
#contains values of colums for which indinces match as in left table's
#else NaN filled
